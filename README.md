# BHAIBOT - THE ONLY BOT YOU NEED
--- --- ---
## What is Bhaibot?
Bhaibot is a chatbot that is made for the sole purpose of making your life easier. It has a lot of features that will help you in your day-to-day life. It is a multipurpose bot that can do a lot of things. It is made by a group of friends who are passionate about coding and want to make a difference in the world. We are a group of 3 people who are working on this project. We are trying to make a bot that can
1. Understand and talk to you like a human
2. Help you with remembering day-to-day things
3. Help you with your studies/work
4. Have fun with you
5. And a lot more...

## How to use Bhaibot?
Bhaibot is a very easy to use bot. It is made for everyone. We are trying to integrate it with as many platforms as possible so that you can use it anywhere you want. Currently, it is available on Telegram and Discord. You can use it on any of these platforms. The functions are same for both the platforms. You can find the functions in the [functions.md](./functions.md) file. You can also use the `help` keyword in your input to get the list of all the functions. Bhaibot is an AI Project so it can understand what you say. You can talk to it in english like you would to any human being. At the same time, we must remember that Bhaibot is a bot and not a human. So, it might not understand everything you say. But we are trying to make it better everyday. You can also use the `feedback` or `improve` keyword in your input to give us feedback about the bot. We will be happy to hear from you.
